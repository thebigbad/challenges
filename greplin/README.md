The Greplin Programming Challenge

So it begins...

----------------------------------------

Welcome to the Greplin Programming Challenge.  You should try to complete all
three levels in a single sitting.  It should take anywhere from 20 minutes to
2 hours.

Level 1

----------------------------------------

Embedded in this block of text is the password for level 2.
The password is the longest substring that is the same in reverse.

As an example, if the input was "I like racecars that go fast"
the password would be "racecar".

Level 2

----------------------------------------

Congratulations.  You have reached level 2.

To get the password for level 3, write code to find the first prime
fibonacci number larger than a given minimum.  For example, the first
prime fibonacci number larger than 10 is 13.

Step 1. Use your code to compute the smallest prime fibonacci number
greater than 227,000.  Call this number X.

Step 2. The password for level 3 is the sum of prime divisors of X + 1.

For the second portion of this task, note that for the number 12 we consider the
sum of the prime divisors to be 2 + 3 = 5.  We do not include 2 twice even
though it divides 12 twice.

Level 3

----------------------------------------

Congratulations.  You have reached the final level.

For the final task, you must find all subsets of an array
where the largest number is the sum of the remaining numbers.
For example, for an input of:

(1, 2, 3, 4, 6)

the subsets would be

1 + 2 = 3
1 + 3 = 4
2 + 4 = 6
1 + 2 + 3 = 6

Here is the list of numbers you should run your code on.
The password is the number of subsets.  In the above case the
answer would be 4.
