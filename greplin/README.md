The Greplin Programming Challenge

So it begins...

----------------------------------------

Welcome to the Greplin Programming Challenge.  You should try to complete all
three levels in a single sitting.  It should take anywhere from 20 minutes to
2 hours.

Level 1
----------------------------------------

Embedded in this block of text is the password for level 2.
The password is the longest substring that is the same in reverse.

As an example, if the input was "I like racecars that go fast"
the password would be "racecar".
